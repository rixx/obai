== Recipe ==
We did some initial toying around and ended up with the following ingredient ratios.

Ingredient^Amount^
|Sugar|81.84%|
|Guarana|6.19%|
|Citric Acid|5.29%|
|Sodiumbicarbonate|2.59%|
|Aroma|2.5%|
|Caffeine|1.6%|

== Safety Information ==

Just some stuff you ought to know.

* Clean your workspace before and afterwards. Obviously.
* Wear gloves -- caffeine can be absorbed by your skin and ciric acid is â€¦ acid.
* Caffeine is poisonous. People are not sure if the LD50 is at 1.5g or 4g. Please take care.
* Caffeine will also be absorbed if you breath in caffeine dust. Mix your ingredients in a closed container and let it rest for a few seconds before opening it.
* Citric acid is an acid. Do not put in your nose. Do not put anywhere except for your mouth. People did this and were very sorry.
* It is only science if you write it down.
* Label your final product to be safer when walking around with strange suspicios looking powder. (We've got labels at our workshop.)
* If you are underage, bring your guardian or a written form of consent.


== Costs ==
We try to cover our costs:
 * 25ct per test-tube (4g) of Obai sherbet
 * 50ct per test-tube if you don't mix your own sherbet
