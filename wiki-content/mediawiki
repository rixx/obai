== Safety Information ==

Just some stuff you ought to know.

* Clean your workspace before and afterwards. Obviously.
* Wear gloves -- caffeine can be absorbed by your skin and ciric acid is â€¦ acid.
* Caffeine is poisonous. People are not sure if the LD50 is at 1.5g or 4g. Please take care.
* Caffeine will also be absorbed if you breath in caffeine dust. Mix your ingredients in a closed container and let it rest for a few seconds before opening it.
* Citric acid is an acid. Do not put in your nose. Do not put anywhere except for your mouth. People did this and were very sorry.
* It is only science if you write it down.
* Label your final product to be safer when walking around with strange suspicios looking powder. (We've got labels at our workshop.)
* If you are underage, bring your guardian or a written form of consent.


== Costs ==
We try to cover our costs:
 * 25ct per test-tube (4g) of Obai sherbet
 * 50ct per test-tube if you don't mix your own sherbet


== Trivia ==
* citric acid + baking powder == fizz
* once you mix citric acid and baking powder, try to keep the mixture as dry as possible until you consume the sherbet. Even air humidity is sufficient to turn your nice caffeine powder into a lumpy mess.
* for optimum fizz, use citric acid and baking powder in a 2.2:1 ratio
* the aroma is optional, though it helps to cover the bitter taste of both caffeine and guarana
* guarana itself contains 3% to 5% caffeine
