#Workshop

Read the `safety.md` and the `README.me` and you are well on your way to making your own caffeine sherbet! A few other things we like to tell folks in our workshops:

* citric acid + baking powder == fizz
* once you mix citric acid and baking powder, try to keep the mixture as dry as possible until you consume the sherbet. Even air humidity is sufficient to turn your nice caffeine powder into a lumpy mess.
* for optimum fizz, use citric acid and baking powder in a 2.2:1 ratio
* the aroma is optional, though it helps to cover the bitter taste of both caffeine and guarana
* guarana itself contains 3% to 5% caffeine

# Costs

We try to cover our costs:
 * 25ct per test-tube (4g) of Obai sherbet
 * 50ct per test-tube if you don't mix your own sherbet
